# TicketService

Implement a simple ticket service that facilitates the discovery, temporary hold, and final reservation of seats within a high-demand performance venue.

### Assumptions

1. There are only 34 seats per tier(1 to 10) in venue, 1st being the best tier and 10 is least prefered tier. Seat numbers are not there in Venue.
2. SeatHolds are valid only for 60 seconds can be configurable.
3. User can hold only MAX of 10 seats per transaction.

### Technology stack used:

Spring Boot 2.0.4, Database : HSQL in-memory DB.
END to End Testing: ATDD- Cucumber-java .
Functional Test: Spring-boot-test, Mockito, PowerMock. 
Build tool : Maven.

### Build and Running the application: 

1. Git clone the project locally and run "mvn clean install".
2. Run the command "java -jar target\ticketservice-api-0.1.0.jar" to start the API.
3. For testing open new terminal and cd to TicketService/TicketService-ATDD/ and run "mvn clean test", it will run different scenarios against the localy running server.

### Sample requests and Responses:
